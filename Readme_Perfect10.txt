Ivan's Question: "Is the data representative enough?"
Question x: Does proximity to manufacturing facility have an impact on life expectancy
Question 2: If proximity does impact life expectancy, then should residents pay more for health insurance?
Question 3: Is there a trend as we move away from the facilities, in terms of life expectancy and house pricing?
