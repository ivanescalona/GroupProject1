Data sets we are using for the project:

Work in progress:
    - Pollution (We have to narrow it down to a type of pollution, the original link Megan suggested talks about air pollutants)
    - Health (Life expectancy)
    - Economic factors (House prices and location to cross reference it with the other datasets)

Good luck to us!
