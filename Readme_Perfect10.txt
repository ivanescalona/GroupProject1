Data sets we are using for the project:

Work in progress:
    - Pollution https://www.kaggle.com/jaseibert/us-facilitylevel-air-pollution-20102014
    - Health (Life expectancy)
    - Economic factors (House prices and location to cross reference it with the other datasets)

Good luck to us!

Ivan's Question: "Is the data representative enough?"
Question x: Does proximity to manufacturing facility have an impact on life expectancy
Question 2: If proximity does impact life expectancy, then should residents pay more for health insurance?
Question 3: Is there a trend as we move away from the facilities, in terms of life expectancy and house pricing?
